I was put on it because of my increased risk for developing breast cancer. I have had no side effects at all. I also feel much calmer and relaxed. Before my period I would get very emotional and moody. Since I no longer have periods, I no longer experience this. I seem to be craving candy, but probably just trying to blame my sweet tooth on something besides my lack of will power. I have also lost 8 pounds",1,0,1,0,1,1,10,http://www.drugs.com/comments/tamoxifen/for-breast-cancer.html,tamoxifen"I was diagnosed with DC breast cancer in November 2014.

I feel bad pretty much all the time. Always sick to my stomach . Working out makes me feel more sick, but I push thru it anyway. No matter what I do I can't drop weight.

I am 52 years old. My primary complaint is insomnia. I have become a light sleeper, waking up 10-20 each night. While I am able to fall asleep again, I never feel as though I have had a deep, restful sleep. I take my tamoxifen in the morning after I brush my teeth. A year post diagnosis which included surgery (partial mastectomy), chemotherapy, 25 rounds of radiation and now tamoxifen, I have endeavoured to train for an Iroman race in August.

After much research and talking to doctors, the conclusion is that Chemo and Tamoxifen seem to have precipitated other chronic illnesses, Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia, OsteoArthirtis, Osteopenia, Clinical depression, Gastroenteritis, worsened IBS and PTSD. My legs, lower back & fingers are usually swollen and usually in pain. I wanted off the Tamoxifen, due to the weakness in my legs & Fatigue. No other was as effective in inhibiting estrogen.

Here's my story: I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer (98% estrogen fed) in Alr 2015. I did not need chemo or radiation. I was told after surgery (June 2015) that I had to take ""Tomy"" for 5 years. I fought the idea, but eventually decided to give it a try. So far, the main complaint I have is fatigue. I take it at night and that's helps... Some joint pain, vaginal discharge (clear mostly) and the BEST thing about Tommy is that it has calms me down. I am about 30% of the energized person I was before. I no longer get feel like I need to solve the worlds problems in a day! So, I can honesty say, that's a big plus! ...

The side effects kicked in after about a week. My fingers completely seized up and if I crouched down I couldn't get up again! The joint pain was unbearable so my oncologist decided to take me off it for 6 months. He then introduced it gradually, 10mg a day instead of 20mg. So far so good! After 6 months of that he put me back up to the full dose and the pain didn't return! I've been on it ever since. My periods are here and there but are quite heavy and painful when I do get them.

I had said I would try it for one year and I'm not sure I can make that. It appears that quality of life is not something my doctor cares about. It's almost as if he's being paid by the tamoxifen people because he won't even listen to anything negative about the drug. My hot flashes are unbelievable. My joint pain makes it difficult to walk.

After experiencing stomach digestive issues I went off it in March 2014 until August, then back on and have been on it ever since. So almost 1 year straight, but another 5 months of it before that as well. My biggest complaint is feeling so wiped out by the end of the day. I take it at night when going to bed, usually 10pm-ish. Does anyone think switching the time I take the pill will matter? I have also noticed a 5-10 pound weight gain. I'm very active and fit - lift weights, run, do crossfit.

I do find it uncomfortable to only read about ladies issues, but understandable. I have found that I feel depressed, and mood swings for sure. Upset tummy is common, so try to keep hydrated. Seem to get lethargic, tired around 3-5pm, but take my medication just before bed, 10-11pm. May consider changing this. Given the alternatives and worrying how my family would cope without me as the bread winner, makes the decision to continue to take it an easy one. I am not going to give in to it. I'm 59, and lost my brother to it aged 39. Played my first 70 min game of tennis today in 14 months, and really found it made a difference.

I too was told I need to be on it for 10 years. Considering the alternative, I don't have too many bad things to say about it. Glad to be cancer free!! Hope this keeps me that way.

I was on it for 5 years, and stopped - at that time it was thought I should only take it for 5yrs. A year after being off and the new research came out that I should do it another 5 years. I've been back on now for about 6 months and I'm seriously considering stopping. Side effects are so bad that I'm having a hard time getting through life. Mood swings and bone pain are my 2 main issues. The thing is, I'm cancer free and of course want to stay that way. I think that if my Doctors were more realistic (honest) about the side effects it would be a little easier to deal with them.

I had been on Effexor for a couple of years, so when I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer I carried on with the medication. I started taking Tamoxifen about a month ago. So far I am very fatigued, have headaches and some physical aches and pains. I take my Tamoxifen in the morning, with my breakfast, because that seems to calm the nausea that I can get with an empty stomach. The best thing that I am experiencing now that I am on the Tamoxifen is the ability to cry and work through emotion. That ability had left me while I was just on the Effexor, I still felt sad, but didn't feel like I could cry. Well the tears come now, and they feel cleansing and good. I have much less anxiety about having a cancer re-occurrence.",3,0,0,0,0,2,7,http://www.drugs.com/comments/tamoxifen/for-breast-cancer.html,tamoxifenThe wisest decision I can share is changing WHEN I take the tamoxifen. I decided that sleep was imperative in order to deal with the side effects. I take the tamoxifen during the day I live in CA so temp- wise this is a good thing to do. Running hot is an understatement. Skin and hair have taken a hit as the hips have improved. Suspect no juice to connective tissues is the reason also arthritis has shown up in both knees. One perk? Evenness of mood after 2 years. My 10 rating?
